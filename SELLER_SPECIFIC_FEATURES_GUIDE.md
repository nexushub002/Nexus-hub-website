## 🔒 Security Implementation

### **Backend Security**
```javascript
// Every API endpoint validates seller ownership
- GET /api/seller/products/my-products
- POST /api/seller/products/create  
- PUT /api/seller/products/update/:id
- DELETE /api/seller/products/delete/:id
- GET /api/seller/orders/my-orders
- PUT /api/seller/orders/update-status/:id
```

### **Ownership Validation**
```javascript
// Products: seller field must match authenticated user
const product = await Product.findOne({
  _id: productId,
  seller: sellerId  // Ensures ownership
});

// Orders: only items from seller's products
const sellerItems = order.items.filter(item => 
  productIds.includes(item.product._id)
);
```

### **Data Filtering**
- **Products**: `{ seller: sellerId }` filter on all queries
- **Orders**: Filter by seller's product IDs
- **Statistics**: Calculated only from seller's data
